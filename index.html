        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I never knew that what would start as a subject in my school would become my passion later. Development of all sorts is my joy. For now I find respite in making aestheticaly pleasing Websites but soon enough my expertise would cover many fields of development.</p>

        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
        <p>It all started with my habit of capturing beautiful scenes. Soon I wanted to share them and before I knew it, I fell in love. Photoshop is my personal playground of imagination and I love playing in it and letting my creativity free.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I love to eat tasty food but more than that I enjoy cooking meals for others to enjoy. I love to experiment with food, very often the results are good. Other times, not so much. But still I feel glad to be able to say proudly,"I can cook!"</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>I am grateful to god for the ability to think (or overthink). What's a man without thoughts and I love to express them in front of others and I like doing so in the form of articles. Articles that motivate, inform or simply make someone feel good.</p>
